  summary: 'DeLTA (Deep Learning for Time-lapse Analysis) is a deep learning-based image processing pipeline for segmenting and tracking single cells in time-lapse microscopy movies'
  description: |
    DeLTA can process movies of rod-shaped bacteria growing in 2D setups such as
    agarose pads, as well as movies of E. coli cells trapped in a microfluidic
    device known as a mother machine. The pipeline is centered around two U-Net
    neural networks that are used for binary segmnetation and tracking cells
    frame to frame.
